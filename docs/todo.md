# TO-DO
This is a to-do list.

1. Figure out if this is the best way, or the "git" way, of doing to-do lists.
2. Need to apply the Cintra (2013) algorithm to all the municipality feature classes in each geodatabase.
3. What were the administrative differences between capitanías? In which way did the semi-autonomous capitanías function differently from Crown-controlled areas?
4. Export Cintra classification to .dta and merge with census data.
5. Write down the identification strategy.
6. What tests would we run ex-post? What if the results are zero o negative? What mechanisms would we want to test to understand a negative/null effect?
